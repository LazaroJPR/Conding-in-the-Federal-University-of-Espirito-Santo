A graph is a data structure that is defined by two components :

1- A node or a vertex.
2- An edge E or ordered pair is a connection between two nodes u,v that is identified by unique pair(u,v). The pair (u,v) is ordered because (u,v) is not same as (v,u) in case of directed graph.The edge may have a weight or is set to one in case of unweighted graph.
